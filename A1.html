    <ul>
        <li>I'm a painter in my free time</li>
        <li>I have a black belt in Kung Fu</li>
        <li>I have an unhealthy obsession with Grimes</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>I am familiar with the basics of HTML and CSS. I have taken a couple classes and done a few different web design projects using these languages. 
        I am most comfortable coding in Python as that is where most of my experience is, and Javascript is going to be completely new to me.
            </p>
    <p>Through this class, I would like to gain a further understanding of how these technologies are used in the modern-day workplace. This is so I can better apply the skills that I already have, 
        and build upon my skillset in a way that will be helpful in most any company and work environment.</p>
